Determining how large of a sample is needed is an important step when planning studies; if too large, resources could be wasted and if too small, the usefulness of any results can be greatly affected. A key factor in choosing an appropriate sample size is the goal of the particular analysis. If explanation, as reflected by hypothesis tests of particular regression coefficients is the goal, there are many existing and different types of methods to help guide researchers with sample size calculations. However, if the goal of a study is prediction, then available methods are more limited. Through many different defined scenarios, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to assess the predictive accuracy of multiple linear regression models that are trained on various sample sizes according to some previously proposed conventional rules...

This paper discusses how a variety of actuarial models can be implemented and analyzed with a Bayesian approach using Gibbs sampling, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. This approach allows a practitioner to analyze complicated actuarial models by reducing them to simpler, more manageable models. Furthermore, general properties of Gibbs sampling are discussed through a simulation approach. [Click here to continue reading!](https://coltongearhart.github.io/greaves/)

This project takes NOAA data to visualize the affect of climate change on minimum and maximum daily temperatures, as well as precipitation levels, over time for three different locations around the world. With the collected data, the data visualization process from start to finish is explained and demonstrated at each step building up to the final visuals.

In this mini course we will be exploring the use of computing and non-parametric method in statistical practice. This will look like a set of general programming and computing topics and methods. This will require that we use a statistical programming language in sophisticated ways, and the module will specifically explore techniques for advanced programming in R.

These course notes introduce regression models and accompanying assumptions. In addition, they cover the theory of least squares to understand the statistical inference procedures behind linear models. Extensive applications of modeling in R will be demonstrated, with a goal of being able to understand strengths and limitations of models. These will be applied to predict and perform inference, while developing sensitivity to important model assumptions.

These course notes introduce the Bayesian approach to statistical inference for data analysis in a variety of applications. Topics include: comparison of Bayesian and frequentist methods, Bayesian model specification, prior elicitation, Markov chain Monte Carlo, Bayes factor, Model selection, hierarchical models, Bayesian regression models. Implementation of Bayesian data analysis will be done using R and Stan. [Click here to view the course notes!](https://coltongearhart.github.io/bayes/)

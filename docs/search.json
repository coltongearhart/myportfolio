    "text": "Mathematical Statistics ‚Äì Ball State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical statistics is the study of how to deal with data by means of probability models. It grew out of methods for treating data that were obtained by some repetitive operation such as those encountered in games of chance and in industrial processes. These methods soon found application in such diverse fields as medical research, insurance, marketing, agriculture, chemistry, and in industrial experimentation. This course is, therefore, a required course for statistics and actuarial science majors and is an excellent course for those who may need in their work statistical methods at a reasonably sophisticated level.

This will look like a set of general programming and computing topics and methods. This will require that we use a statistical programming language in sophisticated ways, and the module will specifically explore techniques for advanced programming in R. Click here to view the mini-course!\n\n\n\n\nRegression\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese course notes introduce regression models and accompanying assumptions. In addition, they cover the theory of least squares to understand the statistical inference procedures behind linear models. Extensive applications of modeling in R will be demonstrated, with a goal of being able to understand strengths and limitations of models. These will be applied to predict and perform inference, while developing sensitivity to important model assumptions.

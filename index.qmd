I am an actuary at Stillwater Insurance Group. I love using `R`, `tidyverse` and am getting into `quarto`. In my free time, I enjoy climbing üßó, cooking üç≤, practicing Spanish, and avidly supporting Liverpool soccer ‚öΩ.

Lastly, I have benefited greatly from the open source community as a professional, an educator and a student. I hope to pay it forward as much as I can. Feel free to use any content you find here, even better if you shoot me a message letting me know how!

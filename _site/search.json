    "text": "Probability ‚Äì Ball State University\n\n\nThe concepts of probability are of great importance in a wide variety of applications. The theory of probability, as the foundation upon which the methods of statistics are based, should command the attention of those who what to understand as well as apply statistical techniques. This course, therefore, is a required course for those who want to major in statistics or actuarial science and is an excellent course for those who are in mathematics, business, and other allied fields.

    "text": "Mathematical Statistics ‚Äì Ball State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical statistics is the study of how to deal with data by means of probability models. It grew out of methods for treating data that were obtained by some repetitive operation such as those encountered in games of chance and in industrial processes. These methods soon found application in such diverse fields as medical research, insurance, marketing, agriculture, chemistry, and in industrial experimentation. This course is, therefore, a required course for statistics and actuarial science majors and is an excellent course for those who may need in their work statistical methods at a reasonably sophisticated level.
